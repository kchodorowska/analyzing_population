# analyzing_population

Analysing population is a project done as part of the Data Visualisation of Economic Data class.  The aim of this project was to present data on the population of individual provinces in Poland using the choropleth map. The interactive maps do not display on the github site, so if you care to see the maps go to https://nbviewer.org/ enter https://github.com/kchodorowska/analyzing_population/blob/main/Vis_project.ipynb and go.
